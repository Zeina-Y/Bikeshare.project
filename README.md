# Bike Share Data Analysis
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project aims to provide insights into bike share usage patterns by computing descriptive statistics.

## Project Overview
In this project, Python is used to analyze bike share data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider. The analysis includes the following statistics:

1. **Popular times of travel**:
    - Most common month
      
    - Most common day of week
      
    - Most common hour of day

2. **Popular stations and trips**:
    - Most common start station
      
    - Most common end station
      
    - Most common trip from start to end

3. **Trip duration**:
    - Total travel time
      
    - Average travel time  

4. **User info**:
    - Counts of each user type
      
    - Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  
    - Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are provided in the `data` directory. The data files are as follows:

- `chicago.csv`
  
- `new_york_city.csv`
  
- `washington.csv`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
  
- Pandas library

### Running the Analysis
The analysis is performed using the script `bikeshare.py` located in the `src` directory. To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
python src/bikeshare.py
```

### Example Usage
When you run the script, you'll be prompted to select a city and apply filters by month or day. The script will then display various statistics based on your selection.

### Additional Information
- The script allows you to view individual trip data upon request.

- The script provides an option to restart the analysis with different filters.
